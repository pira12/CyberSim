The number and severity of cyber attacks are rising steeply, making it increasingly difficult to
ensure the security of IT systems. The aim of this project is to develop a simulator to support
experimentation with different cybersecurity risk management methods, including the
assessment of risks and the selection of appropriate risk mitigation actions. On the one hand,
the simulator should simulate attackers that can perform different actions to compromise
different components of an IT system with different vulnerabilities. On the other hand, the
simulator should simulate a defender who has finite resources to implement risk mitigation
actions to defend the system's valuable components. The simulator should support actions with
different duration, pre-conditions and effects, non-determinism, and limited observability. The
simulator should make it possible to implement and experimentally compare different
decision-making strategies for both the attackers and the defenders.
